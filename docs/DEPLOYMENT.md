# TOPPER.top Deployment Guide

This document provides instructions for deploying the TOPPER.top application to various environments.

## 1. Local Development

For local development, follow the "Quick start" instructions in the main `README.md`.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/topper.top.git
    cd topper.top
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Seed demo data:**
    ```bash
    npm run seed
    ```
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 2. Docker Deployment (Development)

A development Docker setup is provided for consistent environments across machines.

1.  **Navigate to the project root.**
2.  **Build and run with Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build
    ```
    This command builds the Docker image and starts the container. The project directory is mapped into the container, allowing for live code changes without rebuilding the image. The application will be accessible via the port configured in `docker-compose.yml` (typically `http://localhost:3000`).

## 3. Production Deployment (Conceptual)

**Note:** A dedicated production Docker image setup and deployment strategy are currently deferred. The following outlines a conceptual approach for future implementation.

### Build for Production

Before deploying to a production environment, the application needs to be built for production.

1.  **Install dependencies (if not already done):**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Build the application:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript and places the output in the `dist/` directory.

### Running in Production

To run the compiled application in production:

```bash
node dist/server.js
```

### Production Considerations

- **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables for configuration (e.g., port, database connection strings, API keys) instead of hardcoding them. A `.env` file is suitable for local development, but production environments should manage these securely (e.g., Kubernetes secrets, cloud provider environment variables).
- **Process Management:** Use a process manager like PM2 or systemd to keep the application running, restart it on crashes, and manage logs.
- **Reverse Proxy:** Place a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache) in front of the Node.js application to handle SSL termination, load balancing, and serving static assets efficiently.
- **Logging:** Implement robust logging to a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, cloud logging services).
- **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring and alerting for application performance, errors, and resource utilization.
- **Database:** Replace the file-based JSON data storage with a robust production-grade database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
- **Security:** Implement security best practices, including input validation, authentication, authorization, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.
- **Scalability:** Design for scalability, considering load balancing and horizontal scaling of the Node.js instances.

## 4. CI/CD Integration

The project includes a basic CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that performs linting, formatting checks, building, and testing on pull requests and pushes to `main`. For production deployments, this workflow should be extended to include:

- **Automated Deployment:** Automatically deploy the built application to staging or production environments upon successful CI pipeline completion.
- **Containerization:** Create a production-optimized Docker image.
- **Rollback Strategy:** Define a clear rollback strategy in case of deployment failures.
