  - Add dependency update automation (Renovate)
  - Improve TypeScript strictness
- **Benefits**: Consistent code quality, reduced technical debt

## 6. Technical Stack Improvements

### 6.1 Modern Build Tools

- **Current Issue**: Basic setup without optimization
- **Recommendation**:
  - Use Vite for faster development and build times
  - Implement proper asset optimization
  - Add bundle analysis tools
- **Benefits**: Faster development cycle, optimized production bundles

### 6.2 Type Safety

- **Current Issue**: Limited type coverage in frontend code
- **Recommendation**:
  - Convert frontend JavaScript to TypeScript
  - Create proper type definitions for API responses
  - Use strict TypeScript configuration
- **Benefits**: Fewer runtime errors, better IDE support, improved maintainability

## 7. Data Model Enhancements

### 7.1 Content Enrichment

- **Current Issue**: Basic content model without categorization
- **Recommendation**:
  - Implement content categorization system
  - Add content metadata extraction
  - Implement content recommendation algorithm
